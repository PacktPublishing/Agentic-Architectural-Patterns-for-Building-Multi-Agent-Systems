Generative AI has moved beyond the hype, and enterprises now face the challenge of turning prototypes into scalable solutions. This book is your guide to building intelligent agents powered by LLMs.
Starting with a GenAI maturity model, you’ll learn how to assess your organization’s readiness and create a roadmap toward agentic AI adoption. You’ll master foundational topics such as model selection and LLM deployment, progressing to advanced methods such as RAG, fine-tuning, in-context learning, and LLMOps, especially in the context of agentic AI. You'll explore a rich library of agentic AI design patterns to address coordination, explainability, fault tolerance, and human-agent interaction. This book introduces a concrete, hierarchical multi-agent architecture where high-level Orchestrator agents manage complex business workflows by delegating entire sub-processes to specialized agents. You’ll see how these agents collaborate and communicate using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.
To ensure your systems are production-ready, we provide a practical framework for observability using lifecycle callbacks, giving you the granular traceability needed for debugging, compliance, and cost management. Each pattern is backed by real-world scenarios and code examples using the open-source Agent Development Kit (ADK).</details>
