        "# **Use Case: Building a Compliance-Aware Loan Origination Agent**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous chapters, we explored the theoretical architectures of multi-agent systems and the importance of reasoning patterns. Now, we will translate those concepts into a concrete implementation. This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated **Loan Origination Agent** built using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike simple chatbots that generate text based on a single prompt, this agent is designed to execute a mission-critical business process: evaluating a loan application. To achieve high accuracy and strict regulatory adherence, we implement the **Fractal Chain of Thought (FCoT)** pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define Specialized Tools:** Create Python-based tools that simulate real-world financial systems (Document Validation, Credit Checks, Risk Assessment, and Compliance).  \n",
        "2. **Implement the FCoT Pattern:** Structure the agent's system instructions to force a recursive \"Recap, Reason, Verify\" loop, ensuring the agent double-checks its own logic before making a decision.  \n",
        "3. **Orchestrate the Workflow:** Use the ADK's `BuiltInPlanner` to let the agent autonomously determine the sequence of tool execution.  \n",
        "4. **Handle Branching Logic:** Observe how the agent adapts its behavior for different borrower profiles (the \"Happy Path\" vs. the \"Risk Path\").\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this exercise, you will have a working prototype of an agent that doesn't just \"guess\" an answer, but builds a verifiable, auditable case for its decision—a requirement for any production-grade enterprise system.\n",

Now, the real work begins. I need to quantify the risk we're facing, and fast.  A quick mental calculation tells me this is going to be a tough one, particularly with a loan amount of $350,000.  Time to pull up the `assess_risk` tool and feed it the raw data. I'll input a `credit_score` of 450 and a `loan_amount` of 350000. Let's see what the model spits out; it's going to be crucial in deciding our next steps.\n",

            "First, the documents, `doc_id_123` and `doc_income_456`, are good to go - validation is complete. But the credit check is where things get tricky. Borrower-400's credit score is only 450. That screams \"compromised\" history to me. Then, running the numbers with this score and a loan request of $350,000, the risk assessment comes back as \"high.\" This is where my experience tells me to pay attention. Although the compliance check passed, meaning our process is sound, the underlying risk here is undeniable and significant. Ultimately, given this \"high\" risk level rooted in a seriously compromised credit score of 450, it is my judgement that the application should be declined. I will now formalize this assessment into the JSON and narrative summary for the next stage.\n",
