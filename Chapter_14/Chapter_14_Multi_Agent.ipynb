        "\n",
        "In this advanced use case, we expand upon the previous loan agent by implementing a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** architecture using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of a single agent doing all the work, we utilize an **Orchestrator Agent** that manages a team of specialized sub-agents. This pattern increases reliability and separation of concerns.\n",

        "### **Architecture:**\n",
        "1.  **Orchestrator Agent:** The FCoT-powered manager that plans the workflow and delegates tasks.\n",
